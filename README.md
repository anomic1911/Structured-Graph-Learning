# [Structured Graph Learning Python implementation](https://github.com/anshul3899/Structured-Graph-Learning)
A naive Python implementation of the NeurIPS paper: Structured Graph Learning (SGL) algorithm  by Kumar et. al (2019, https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9339-structured-graph-learning-via-laplacian-spectral-constraints)

## Work in Progress!

### learn k-component graph
Currently only learn_k_component_graph API is available from sgl library.
Load the dataset in main.py. Currently two moon dataset is there. Others are coming sooner!

```python
python main.py
```
plots are generated in the directory [plots](https://github.com/anshul3899/Structured-Graph-Learning/blob/master/plots)

### learn Bipartite graph

Coming Soon!
